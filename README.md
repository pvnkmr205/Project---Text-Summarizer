# Project---Text-Summarizer
A Python-based text summarizer that generates concise and coherent summaries using extractive and abstractive NLP techniques. Built with NLTK, Transformers, and evaluation using ROUGE.
# 📝 Text Summarizer Web App

## 🔍 Overview

**Text Summarizer** is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based web application that generates **concise summaries** from:

- 🧾 User-entered text
- 🌐 Wikipedia article links

The app allows users to compare multiple summarization algorithms and understand the differences between **extractive** and **abstractive** summarization methods.
